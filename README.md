<h1>Currency Exchange App-Mobile</h1>

<p>
   I developed a currency exchange application using react native features. It works smoothly on both IOS and Android devices. The response to the request sent via Axios has been successfully received. This response is conveyed to the user through an interface. More than 200 currencies can be processed from the requested API address. Here we only watched the value changes between USD-EUR-TRY.</p>

<p>Api:(https://api.freecurrencyapi.com/v1/latest)
    react-native-dropdown-select-list
    axios
